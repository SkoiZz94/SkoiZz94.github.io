# üìò JavaScript Projects Documentation

This folder contains three independent JavaScript-based projects:

1. **CyberArk Quiz Application**  
2. **Kanban Board with Clocks**  
3. **WIM Calculator (Portugal)**  

Each script handles different functionality and is documented below.

## 1. Quiz Application (`cyberark.js`)

### Overview
An interactive quiz engine that loads questions from a JSON file, randomizes order, tracks answers, supports multiple correct answers, and calculates pass/fail results.

### Key Features
- Fetches questions from `/data/questions.json` (semicolon-delimited fields for answers).
- Normalizes data into `{question, answers[], correctIndices[], isMultiple}`.
- Shuffles questions and answers independently.
- Tracks:
  - **User answers**
  - **Flagged questions** (skipped from grading but available in review).
- Results view:
  - Pass/fail calculation (default threshold: **80%**).
  - Counts of correct, incorrect, and answered questions.
- Review mode:
  - Shows flagged/answered questions.
  - Marks correct/incorrect answers with ‚úì / ‚úó.

### Utilities
- **DOM helpers** (`$`, `show`, `hide`).
- **Randomization** (`shuffleArray`).
- **Deep clone** via `JSON.stringify`/`parse`.

## 2. Kanban Board with Clocks (`kanban.js`)

### Overview
A calculator that computes an employee‚Äôs attendance score for a given month in **Portugal**, taking into account:

- **Scoring:**
  - Score = `(diasPresentes / diasDisponiveis) √ó 5`.
  - Color-coded result:
    - Red: `< 2`,
    - Yellow: `2 ‚Äì 3`,
    - Green: `> 3`.
